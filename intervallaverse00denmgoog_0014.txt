PREFACE. vii

The selection of verses and translations here printed

has, very kindly, been made by the Rev. H. Montagu
. Butler, D.D., Master of Trinity, and Dr Sandys, Public

’ I orator in the University or Cambridge-himself one or

the three Senior Classics whom Repton has produced.
To both these distinguished scholars, for the generous
advice and assistance they have given, and especially
to Dr Sandys for the labour involved in arranging,

Δ revising and editing the work, the warmest thanks are

due¹ from those members of the writer’s family with
whom they have been associated.

’ Th0ugh non'e of the following lines were originally

² written with a view to publication, the Greek versions ¹·

of “Grays Elegy'' and of “ Black-eyed Susan,” and the 3
English translation of Canon Kynaston's “ Dinner Ode '' ι

were printed during the writers lifetime‚ in deserence
to the desire of friends hest able to judge os their
worth.

ι The collection must be regarded not as the finished
work of a professional scholar, but only as the inci-
dental recreations of a scholarly member of another,
and that an arduous, profession.
