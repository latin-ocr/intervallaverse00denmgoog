INTER VALLA.

To Margaret C„ on lur Birttday.

- Margie‚ once again I pay

Homage to thy natal day.

Now the snow hath lest the ground,
And the buds peep out all round
Now the pinching frosts have ceased,
To the joy of bird and beast.
Almond blossoms now come out,
And the lambkins sport about3
Blackbird, nightingale, and thrush
Music make in grove and bush3
And the Daisy decks the¹ meads
With its gold and silver beads.
Wintry thoughts away we'll fling‚
Bidding weleome to the Spring;
Double welcome to the mom

When our Margery was born.

, Margiel gentle, winsome‚ bright‚

Thought of thee is fresh delight.
Theresore once again I pay
Homage to thy natal day.

April 28, 1889.
