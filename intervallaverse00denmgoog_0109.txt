88 ἱ INTER VAMA.

And I know that, whether on the land, or on the¹
stormy we,

My Willie is in danger, for no lion is so brave 3

If camon-bans are muling, he’ll be soremost in the

Or, isinge’mte be overboard, he'll plunge and risk his
lise ι

He will do it for his honour's sake, his country’s, and
y his ship’s, ,
And, though it kill me, he will die with my name
upon his lips3
So, while the flowers are blooming and all joyous is
the day,
My soul is sad and weary on this lovely mom of May.·

· What sail is that? what noble ship comes sailingy

towards the land?

Be still my heart, is Willie's voice among that cheer·
ing band?

'Tis his gallant Arethusa„ Will she bring him back

And titolis? she flew, her fate to leam, whate’er that
fate might be.

Oh! happy is that meeting, and blessed is the day,

And never did a lovelier pair adom that garden gay3
And never did the church·bells ring a richer, merrier
Thanpeiilhen sweet Mary Mortimer was wed to Willie

Neale.
