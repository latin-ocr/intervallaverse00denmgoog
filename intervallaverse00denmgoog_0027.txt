. 6 INTER VALLA.

Full many a gem, of pures't ray serene,
The darlr unfathom'd caves of ocean bear ;
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

Some village Hampden, that, with dauntless breast,

The little tyrant of his fields withstood; ·
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest 3
Some Cromwell guiltless oi his eountry’s blood.

'rh’ applause of list’ning senates to command,
’ The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,

And read their history in a nation's eyes,

Their lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone

Their growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd ;
Forbad to wade through slaughter to anthrone, ·
Ἴ And shut the gates of mercy on mankind;

The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame, ἱ
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
With incense, kindled at the Muse's hamc.

Far from the madding erowd's ignoble strife,
Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray3
Aloug the cool sequestered vale of life
They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.

Yet ev'n these boues from insult to protect,
Some frail memorial still erected nigh,

With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture vdeclr'd,
Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.
