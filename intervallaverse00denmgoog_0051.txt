INTER VALLA.

When the blazing Son is gone,
Whenhe nothing shiner upon 3

Then you show your little light,
Twiukle, twinkle, all the night

Then the traveller in the dwrk
Thanks you sor your tiny spark3

He could not see which way to go,
If you did not twinkle so.

Iu the dark blue sky you keep,

And often through my curtaius peep 3
For you never shut your eye,

Till the Sun is in the sky.

As your bright and tiny spark
Lights the traveller in the dark,

Tho' 1 know not what you are,
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

Jrnn Toron

Hymns, Antient and Modern, 365.

O Lord os heaven, and earth, and seo,
To Thee all praise and glory be 3

How shall we shew our love to Thee,
Who givest all?

The golden sunshine, vernal air,

Sweet flowers' and fruit, Thy love declare3

When harvests ripen, Thou art there,
Who givest all.
