22 INTER VALLA,

m Fountain.

Down to the vate this water steers:
How merril'y it goes!

’Twill murmur on a thousand years,
And flow as now it flows.

And here, on this delightful day
1 cannot choose but think
How oft, avigorous mon, I lay
Beside this fountain's brink.

My eyes are dim with childish teate,
My heart is idly stirred, ⁰

For the same sound is in my ears
Which in those days I heard.

Thus sares it still in our decay3
. And yet the wiser mind
Mourns less sor what age takes away Α
Than what it leaves behind.

You ask mc why the Muse is mute.

Yon ask me why the Muse is mute
'Mid soenes so fair as these,

When Nature plies her every art,
Her utmost power, to please.
