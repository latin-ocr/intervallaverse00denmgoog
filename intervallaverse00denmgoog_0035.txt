“They'll tell thee, sallom, when away,

“In every port a mistress find

“Hy breath is Afric’s spicy gale,

“Thy skin is ivory so white
“Thus every beauteous obJect that 1 view
“Wakes in my soul some charm of lovely Sue.

“Though battle call me from thy arms,
“Let not my pretty Susan mourn.

“Though cannons roar, yet saie from harms
“William shall to his dear return.

“Love turns aside the balls that round me fly,
“Lest precious tears should drop irom Susan's eye.’'
