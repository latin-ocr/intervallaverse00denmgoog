44 INTER VALLA

Porcule care, valel quocunque animalia pacto
Mortua, quove loco cunque valere solent,

Sis ibi, sis felix! At nobis, parvule, lormae
Pectora jucundae sint memora usque tuael

1871.

Lines written on flymt os Dr Kennedy's “Between
Whiles‚'' presented to Arthur Duke Coleridge. ’

If, wearied with the eternal jaw

Ol counsel learned in the law3

1f, tired with little Wa'glttman’s guile

Or e’en ol Buszard's stately style,

lf, stunned with Harris’ voice and blows,
Your languid spirit seeks repose3

Turn to these peges, and you’ll be

A happy, happy A. D. C.

T. W. Bnoonieii.
