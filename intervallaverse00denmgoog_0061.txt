INTER VALLA.

In the summer of 18 59, Clearles Brvan, the County. Court
Judge ql Cornwall, wishing to leave a holday amad,
and I wishing to find a country-house for tloe Long
Vacan'rn, wc arranged that I should do his Circuit in
exchange sor the uscos bis Home, Boskrnna. On
return to London I sent him thr inclosed. ·

⁸ Boskennn daughter os th’ Atlantic wave,
Where from the cares of life we took our rest,
Whose rocks and groves and winds new vigour gave
And power to face hard duty with new zest3
Farewell, delightful scene! Hail, smoke and strise
And all the Lawyer's unluxurious lise!

But lest that jealous, all-absorbing toil
Shonld banish j0ys, so pure, so free, so good,
Μώοεεῦιαῐῇωιτίεὴωῐὼγνίῐςίῃεοῦ,4
Those rocks, those serns, that breeze·swept spray-
dashed wood;
I pen this tribute of a grateful heart 3 ι
¹ Be thou for ever that which now thou art.

1859.
