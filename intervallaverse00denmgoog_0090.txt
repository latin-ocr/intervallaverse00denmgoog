THE UNIVERSITY BOAT RACE.

Scores on scores, from these descended ·
In aquatic lineage, came 3
Cantabs with Oxonians blended,
Ancients some-some new to Fame:
But my song would ne'er be ended,
Were I every one to name.

Happy was the thought that seated
Mate by mate, crew facing crew 3

Well ye know who have competed
In whate’er 'tis well to do,

How that man is ever greeted
(Friend or soe) who row'd with you.

Fitly 0’er the feast presiding,
All-accomplished Cwmw sits,

Through the toasts how neatly ghding,
Winning cheers‚ redoubling hits-

Not os bat with ball colliding-
Merely sympathy οἱ wits.

Yet another¹, more sonorous‚

Rules our Chief, and checks our chais,
Stills the hum, and quells the chorus,

Moderates the loud ‘Hear! hear!’
Coolly acts the despot o'er us,

As o’er Sheriff or Lord Mayor.

Now the turtle disappeareth,
Now the turbot is despatched;
Sparkling wine our spirit cheereth;
Well are Cam and Isis matched‚
While each man his platter cleareth

Of the fishlets barely hatched.
¹ Mr Harker‚ the Toastmaster.
