INTER VALLA.

GRAY‘S ELEGY.

Tan curfew tolls the knell oi parting day,
The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,

Save where the beetle wheels his droning ssight,
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds 3

Save that, from yonder ivy-mantled tower‚
Τὴθ moping owl does to the Moon complain
Of such as, wand'ring near her secret bower,
Molest her ancient, solitary reign.

· Beneath those rugged elms, that yew·tree’s shade,
Where heaves the turs in many a mould’ring heap,
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.

Τὴε breezy call of incense-breathing mom,
’ The swallow‚ twitt'ring from the strawhuilt shed, .
The cockls shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,

No more shall ronse them from their lowly bed.

For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn, ²
Or busy housewife ply her evening care:

Nor children run to lisp their sire's return,
Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.
