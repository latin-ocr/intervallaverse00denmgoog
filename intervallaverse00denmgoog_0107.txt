INTER VALLA.

Never idle, never vain,
All false ways declining, ·

·’ Patient in distress and pain,

Tried, yet unrepining.

Friends who thoughtless were before,
As they watched her bearing,

Wondered at the grace she wore,
And her grace in wearing.

Marvelled what that secret power
In her soul existing‚

Day by day, and hour by hour,
Worldly wiles resisting3 ’

Marvelled how, where'er she went,
Love and peace too entered,

Innocence and ⁴sweet content
Seeming in her centred.

Wondering thus, her friends in vain
Pressed her to discover

What that locket might contain‚
Gist9f friend or lover? μ

That gold locket which she wore,
'Ne’er to any speaking

Of the secret which it bore,
Though they oft were seeking‚

Was it a lost parent's hair
who, on deathbed lying‚

. Begged her that small gift to wear

'Till she too were dying?
