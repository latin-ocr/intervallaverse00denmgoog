Tums triumphant to the gnemsey,
By a reverend Phaniam sent; ¹
Reads, ‘that though to come he bnms, he
Must not come or he’d repent,
For that, wheresoe’er he tumS, he
Duties finds because 'tis Lenn'

Roenns next (how grand of feature,
Broad of shoulder, deep os chest i),
Brimming over with good nature, .

Tells the tale which wrings our breast,

How that horse (poor blundering creature 1)
Well-nigh sent him to his rest.

Tooeoon (once too good sor Granta)
Brings ln's gnernsey on his back,

, Then, like some gigantic plantet,

Gives his chest a hearty smack,
And with reverential banter,
Deigns a modest joke to crach.

Menivnns, historian famous,
Proves that Cambridge would have won,
Had- not Fate resolved to tame us,
Han not sons of Isis done
Better e'en than sons of Camus
In that Boat Race number one.

Up rose Bassa, once seven to summ,
Every inch the Judge-the man:

. Upright, downright, comely, manly,

(Beat him, Oxsord, if you canl),
All that’s brave and gentlemanly,
Since to ron he first began.
