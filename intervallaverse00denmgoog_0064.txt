DOMESTICA. 43

Translation by H J Hodgson, Mastcr of the Com of
Quem's Bench, formerly Fellow os Trinity.

Many thanks for the verses you’ve sent me, my boy,
Il they're all your own doing, I give you much j0y.
Write again, be the style such as old ovid chose,
When he sang os his loves or lamented his woes 3·
Or, ifVirgil's your model, you vill not go wrong,
Or Horace, that elegant master ol song.

Try your hand is you can't a smart epigram write,
Or in hendecasyllables laughter invite;

Be it virgil, Catullus or Ovio, my lad,

Depend on't your verses will please your old Dad.

On the death of a saoourite guimaptg

Now swoll’n with crying are our Sarah's eyes
Sad Jane refuses from h'er chair to rise3
Mamma and Edith groan without relies ;
William, Pip¹‚ Gracie, all are plunged in grief.
For lovely Wiggy⁹ from this lise hath flown3

· His beauteous form upon the ground is strown.
No more shall sparkle now his jet-blaclr eye ,·
No more his voice shall grunt sweet melody;
Parsley no more nor apples shall delighg

By Arthur's liberal hand placed in his sight ;
Never again with ardour shall he burn

Fell rats to conquer‚ ne’er to us return.

¹ Francus. ⁹ Porculus.
