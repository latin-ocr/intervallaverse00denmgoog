INTER VALLA.

Rivalling iu lightuess
Stars in summer skies,

Or the dewy brightness
Of a maideu's eyes.

Said 1 “Sweetest 'flower
Thou shalt come to me3
Happy was the bour,

. eren 1 chunoed on thee!”

Then it cried “Why take me
From the forest-gude?

Prythee do not break me
But to let me fade”

O'er it long 1 tarried‚

Moved its roots with care, '
’ And 1 sasely carried
Home that blossom fair.

Then my flower I planted .
In a quiet place,

Gave it all it wanted,
Watched it grow in grace.

Now it is a measure
’ More to me than gold,
And beyond all measure
’Fairer than of old
