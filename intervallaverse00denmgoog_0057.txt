INTER VALLA.

“Mine is nn unchanging love,
“Higher than the heights above;
“Deeper than the depths beneath‚
f‘Free and faithful, strong ns death.

“Thou shalt see My Glory soon,
“When the work os grace is done;
“Partner os My Throne shalt be;

‘⁸ Say, poor sinner‚ lov'st thou Me?''

Lord, it is my chief complaint
That my love is weak and faint 3
Yet 1 love Thee, and adore;
Ohl sor grace to love thee more!
W. Cowrsr.

Churclae Infirmus, 39²· ’

Jerusalem, my happy horne,
When shall 1 corne to thee?

· When shall my sorrows have an end?

Thy j0ys when shall I see?

Ο happy harbour of the saints!
O sweet and pleasant soil!

In thee no sorrow may be found,
No grief, no care, no toil.

There lust and lucre cannot dwell‚
There envy bears no sway3
There is no hunger, heat, nor cold,

v But pleasure every way.

Thy walls are made of precious stones,
Thy bulwarks diamond square3

Thy gates are of right orient pean,
Exceeding rich and rare.
