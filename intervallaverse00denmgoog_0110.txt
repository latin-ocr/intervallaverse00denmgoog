ΟΝ MY BIRTHDA Y. 89

On my Birthday, Anno Aetatis 69.

“Many happy Retums!”

“ 1 was a boy os ten years old:

And when the day carne round
On which I heard those welcome words
How gladsome was their soundt

They spoke os coming manhood:
They brought a host os joys;
Kind greetings3 ‚welcome presens,

ι Os money, books, and toys;

And presence os my fellows,
For which boynatnre yeams,

And thoughts that seemed the heralds
Of numberless ‘returns’

When more than twice ten years had flown,
still those glad words came round,

But something of their freshness
Was wanting to the sonnd.

Still in my heart an echo
Responderi, when some voice

· Said, “Is thy years are many, J
Thy friends will still rejoice.''

And now Ι near the limit

Of three score years and ten,
’ Aster ‘retums' so ‘many’
1 hear those words again.
