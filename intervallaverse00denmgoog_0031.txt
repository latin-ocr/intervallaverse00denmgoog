ιο INTER VALLA.

One mom I miss'd him on the ’custom’d hill,
Along the heath, and near his fav'rite tree:
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
Nor up the lawn, nor atthe wood was he.

ΤΙιε next, with dirges due, in sad army,
Slow thro' the church·yard path we saw him home⁸⁴
Approach and read (sor thou can’st read) the lay,
Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.”

THE EPITAPH.

Here rests his head upon the lap os earth
A youth to fortune and to fame unknown 3

Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
And Melancholy mark'd him for her own ,

Lange was his bounty‚ and his soul sincere, ,
Headn did a recompence as largely send:

He gave to mis'ry all he had, a tear 3

, He gain'd from Heav'n (twas all he wish'd) a friend.

No farther seek his merits to disclose,
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(Tbere they alike in trembling hope repose),
The bosom of his Father and his God.

· Gnhn
