8 INTER VALLA.

Tbeir name, their years, spelt by th’ unlenerd muse, -
The place oi farne and elegy supply:
And many a holy text uound she strena,
That teach the rustic moralist to dic

For who, to dnmb sorgetsulness a prey,
This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
Lelt the warns precincts oi the chceriul day,
Nor cast one longing, lingring look behind?

On some lond breast the parting soul relies,
Some picus drops the closing eye requires:

Ev’n from the tomb the voice oi nature eries,
Ev’n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

For thee, who, mindful of th‘ unhonour’d dead,
Dost in these lines their artless tale relate3
Is, chance, by lonely Contemplation led,
Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy iate,

Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,

“Ost have we seen him, at the peep oi dawn,
Brushing‚ with hasty steps, the dews away,

To meet the sun upon the upland lawn

There, at the ioot oi yonder nodding beech‚
That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
And pore upon the brool< that babbles by.

Hard by yon nond, now smiling‚ as in scom, ”
Mutt’ring his wayward sancies, he would rove;
Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn, ’
Or craz'd with nare, or crossed in hopeless love.
