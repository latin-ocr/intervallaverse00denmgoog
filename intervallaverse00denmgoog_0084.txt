Domi habuit unde disceret.

A Doctor's son, not grounded well in grammar,

Was sent to Jones‚ a celebrated crammer; =

He learnt “Achilles’ wrath,” and “myriad woes,'²

But here his studies had a sudden close 3

For, when on “Hennes' souls untimely sent

To Pluto’s realm'' a weary honr he'd spent,

“ Dear Jones,'’ his father wrote, ‘⁴ Thanks3 let him come
“ Here, for you teach what he can leam at home.

“ For, though no scholar, I know how by legions

“ To speed men's souls down to the lower regions.'’ =

1876.

Ad sortem sublinunt reservatus.

Once a murderer slept by a rotten old⁴ wall;
In a dream came Serapis and said, . ’

ln oracular tone, “My poor sellow, get up;
Go and find a less perilous bed.'’

Then the mmderer wolre, and slept elsewhere 3 but lo!
The old well on a sudden fell down.

So, at mom, to the Gods a thankoff'ring he gave ·
For such favour to homicides shown.

But Serapis again carne by night; and he said,
“Do you think, wretch‚ 1 petroniae crime?

“N03 I saved you from dying a nice easy death,
“And you'll die on the gellows in time.'’
