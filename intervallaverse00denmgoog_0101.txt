INTER VALLA.

And soon (relying on the word -·
· Os Him who died to save) ·
T he Priest. by God's injunction hired, .
' Thy brow will eross and lave.

And name thee by the names which thou
Thaeugh lise may’st feel to be
Remin'ders of the solemn vow
Made at the Font sor thee.

Name osa flower-than which more sweet κ

None in the garden grows—

In' thee may fragrant virtues meet,
And dwell till lite shall close.

Name ofa Queen-fo‘r fisty years

Who o'er our land hath reigned
Midst J'oy and sorrow, smiles and tears,
By trust in God sustaineri

Ohl be thou truly Violet‚
Be thou Victoria too;

Be good as is thy Queen, my pet!
Sweet‚ like that flow’ret bluei'

Ohl ne’er be' thou to foolish ways
By foolish friend enticed,

Nor e’er sorget, in all thy days,
Thou bear’st the mark of Christ.

Noa. 16, 1887.
