THE UNI VERSITll BOA T RACE.

Turn your eyes to that third table,
Where—still sound iu wind aud limb-

Stands that Surru¹‚ who quite unable
(More shame ior him) then to snitu,

Α Sanlr-yet lives! Oh, Fate too stablel

Loftier end's in stote for him.

Next ‘the' Navy and the Army,’

And his well-loved ‘Volunteer,'
Cure‘rr toasts3 and, with a charm he
Α Has alone, provokes a cheer,
While with true Etonian calm, he

Three Etom'ans bids appear. ·

Reggie Buucun, brave Crimean 3
Hortum, brother ol the bold

Sailor Mediterranean3
WARRE, whose sway is uncontrolled,

Naval‚ martial, Herculem, “
Scorning heat, defying cold.

Men like these still make it truthsul
To repeat the Gneus Duru's boast,

That these struggles of the youthlul
Helped to victory that host,

Gallam, active, breve, ‘and ruthsul, ·
Whom Old Eugland honours most.

Once again (the Cheir desiring)
Duuunu toasts those Fatlurs three,
Who convinced a world admiring
That this eightoared tace should be3
Once again (the theme inspiring)

‘Nine times nine, and three times three!
