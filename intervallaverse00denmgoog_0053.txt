INTER VALLA.

For peaeefiss homes, and healtht'ul dtys,
For all the blessings earth displays,

We owe Tbee thankfulnees and praise,
Who givest alL

For souls redeemed, sor sins forgiven,
For means of grace and hopes of heaven,
Fathen what can to Thee be given,

Who givest all?

We lose what on ourselves we spend,
We have as treesure without end

Whatever‚ Lord, to Thee we lend‚ >
t Who givest all.

Whatever, Lord, we lend to Thee
Repaid a thousandfold will be3

Then gladly willye give to Thee,
Who givest all.

To Thee, from Whom we all derive
Our life, our gists, our power to give:
Ο may we ever with Thee live,

’ Who givest al,l.

Cme. Wonnswom, Biskop osLincoln. Ι

Hymns, Andent and Modern, 199.

Thou art the Way t-by Thee alone

From sin and death we flee3
And he who would ,the Father sech,
Must seek Him, Lord, by Thee.
