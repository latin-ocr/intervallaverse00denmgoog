12 INTER VALLA.

BLACK-EYED SUSAN.

All in the Downs the fleet was mooted,
The streamers waving in the wind,
When black-eyed Susan came on board3
“Ohl where shall 1 my true love find?
“Tell me, ye iovial sailors, tell me true,
“Il my sweet William sails among the crew?'’

William, who, high upon the yard,

Rocled with the billows to and fro,
Soon as her well-known voice he heard,

He sighed, and cast his eyes below.
The cord slides swiftly through his glowing hands
And, quick as lightning, on the decl< he stands.

So the sweet lark, high poised m air,

. ’ Shuts close his pinions to his breast,

Is chance his mate's shrill call he hear,
And drops at once into his nest.
The noblest captain in the British fleet
Might envy William’s lips those kisses sweet. '

“0 Susan, Susan, lovely dear,
’ “My vows shall ever true remam,
“Let me kiss off that falling tear;
“We only part to meet again.
“Change as ye list, ye winds3 my heart shall be
“The faithful compass that still points to thee.
