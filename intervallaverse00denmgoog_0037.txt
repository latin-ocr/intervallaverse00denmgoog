16 INTER VALLA.

Lines wn'tten in a grotta at Mclbome, Derbyslu're‚ and
given nu by J. C. morano, Q.c.. MR, with a
nequest for a latin version.

Reet, weary stranger, in this shady cave

And toste, if languid, of the mineral wave3

There’s Virtue in the draught 3 for Health, that flies
From crowded eities and their smolry thies,

Here lende her power to every glade and hm,
Strength to the breeze end medicine to the riu.

Come, Sleepl

Come, Sleept Though image Thou of Death most meet,

Yet, in my grief for thy embrace I sigh3
Come thenl nor soon depart3 for 'tis most sweet
Thus without life to live, thus without death to die.

Life-yet no pain of living-Oh, how sweett
Death-yet no sting of death he feels orhnows,
Whose eye thou closest. In his bosom meet
The bliss of being, and the grave’s repose.

[The first oi the abore stanzas is n translation of the lines com·
posed by Th0mas Warton‚ to be placed under a statue ot Somnus:-

Somne veni, et quanquam certissima Mortis imago es,
Consortem cupio te tamen esse tori!

Huc ades, haud abituro cito: nam sie sine vita
Vivere quam dulce est, sicsine morte mori t]
