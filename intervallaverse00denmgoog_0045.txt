²4 INTER VALLA.

Ohl there are sun-lit heights of bliss
That words can never reach3

And there are thoughts which flood the soul
Beyond the power of speech

As on some deep and silent pool
The sweet reflections stay,

While, lower down, the broken stream
Babbles them all away,

My heart receives each impress fair
And smoothly flows along;

But by and bye‚ 'mid rougher soenes,
’Twill bahble into song.

Horace surra.

He that fights and runs away
May live to light another day3
But he that isin battle slain
Can never live to fight again.

Busrnr, Hudibras.

Love is blind and lovers cannot see
The pretty lollies that themselves commit

snmnsrmns, multant of Venice, ii 6.

For what is true repentance but in thought-
Not even in inmost thought to think again ’

“ The sins that made the past so pleasant to us.
’ Tamassos, Guinencre.
