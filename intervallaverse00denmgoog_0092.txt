THE UNI VERSITY BOATRACE. Ι 71

Then comes talk os winning, losing, ’
Fouling, ‘crabs' untimely caught,
Sinking, catching the beginning,
And of all Tou Ennii taught,
Moumsou or Sunnwnu„ spinning
Yams of deep aquatic thought.

Such the converse-not unbroken-
Some of training would discourse‚
But that band (os ‘vis’ the token)‚
While each course succeeds to course
(Ophicleide, alas! bespoken),
Silences each tongue by force.

Now our hunger hath been sated,
Now with ice our lips been cooled,
And the Chairman well hath stated
How this realm is nobly ruled,
And our Queen and all related ¹
Do their duty wisely schooled ;

· Great the toasts, and great the cheering;
Thrice three times and thrice again
Every man his voice uprearing
To the band's assenting strain,
Loyal suain os men God·fearing
ln this Isle that rules the main.

’ · Now ‘The Chair,' succinctly noting
How whate'er is good or great
Follows from successful boating

In the Chnrch‚ the Law, the State,
Instances of each kind quoting

Some more early, some more late,
