INTER VALLA.

Thy turrets and thy pinnacles
With carbuncles do shine3

Thy very streets are paved with gold,
Surpassing clear and fine.

Ah, my sweet home, Jerusalem,

Would God 1 were in thee!

Would God my woes were at an end,
Thy joys that 1 might see!

Thy saints with glory shall be crowned‚ .
Shall see God iace to sace ;

They triumph still, they still reJ'oice,
Most happy is their ca'se.

Our sweet is mixed with bitter gall,
Our pleasure is but pain,

Our joys scarce last the looking on,
Our sorrows still remain.

Thy gardens and thy gallant walks

· Continually are green,

There grow such sweet and pleasant flowers
As nowhere else are seen. Ἴ

Quite through the streets‚ with silver sound,

The flood of Life doth flow3

Upon whose banks on everyside
The wood oi Life doth grow.

There trees for evermore bear fruit,
And eveunore do spring 3

There evermore the Angeis sit,
And evermore do sing.

Jerusalem, my happy home,
Would God I were in thee!

Would God my woes were at an end,
Thy joys that 1 might see!

From the Latin Hymn‚ Urbs beata Hirusalem. .
