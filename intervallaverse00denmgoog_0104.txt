urrerem rursus, 83

ro Etkel C.‚ on ker Birthday.

Amid the fierce contentious of the Bar,
And the loud turmoil os its wordy war,
How sweet at times, if but in thought, to roam,

⁴ To the kind refuge os some peacesul home!

To think of beings free from noise and suite,
'Free from the jangling of a lawyer's lise3

Unselfish souls, with none but worthy ends3
Kindly as neighbours, true and staunch as friends 3
Whose* very sight is joy afresh to gain,

A truce to toil, an antidote to pain.

Such thoughts as these, dear Ethel‚ are'sor me
Whene’er my Muse bids me to think of thee,

And she doth bid me, therefore I obey .

Now twice nine days have dawned in beauteous May.
Thou, when thou deign’st these verses to peruse‚ ⁴
Tne tecue efron ns my numne 'Mose
Accept the wishes they would sein courcy,
That every blessiug may attend this day

As year succeeds to year and May to May!

'May 18, 1890.
