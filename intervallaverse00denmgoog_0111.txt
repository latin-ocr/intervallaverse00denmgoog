’ INTER VALLA.

And I seem to think it matters .
Much less than once I thought,
‘Returns’ how few or ‘many’
If 1 use them as I ought.

So working for the present
And thankful sor the past,
May my each ‘return' be happy,
Each happier than the last.

And, isthe next should happen
In another world than this,
May it be where sorrows vanish,

And 'nought survives but Bliss!

Dec. 23, 1888.

Paraphrase os the Lord's Prayer..

Ο Thou, at whose command
1 first began to be,

Who daily, with a Fathefs hand,
Dost guard and succour me ;

In Heav'n Thy dwelling place, Ο Lord‚
Angels surround Thy throne,

Ο be Thy name on earth adored,
As now in Heaven alone.

“Thy kingdom come3 Thy will be done‚''
Yea‚ ev'n on earth below, .
May Christ prevail, and Satan fail,

And Good in triumph go!
