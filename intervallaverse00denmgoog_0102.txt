BIRTHDAY VERSES.

To Margaret C„ en her Bethday.

In thy merry rosy face,
. 'Margie Ῑ thy mind can trace ;
In the twinkle of thine eye,
I thy temper can descry3
On thy bron, from wrinkles free,
1 thy kindIy soul can see.

Hail we then the happy morn,
When sweet Margery was born 5
> When this Daisy op’d its eye

First beneothan April sky;

When this precious P'earl was found
In a home where gems abound‚
Siste-treasures each a gem 3

But 'tis not the day sor them,
Therefore I'll contented be,

Margie, thus to write to thee.

For many a year may this glad day
' For thee precede a happy May,
And every Autumn, Winter, Spring,
A happy Summer yearly bring,

Till thou art grown as old as he
Who wishes this, and more, sor thee,
(Thou merry rosy Margery),

And who subscribes himself G. D.
