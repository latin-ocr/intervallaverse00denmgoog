INTER VALLA.

Against ldleness and Mschief.

How ‚doth the little busy bee
Improve each shining bour,

And gather honey all the day
From every opening flower!

How skilfully she builds her cell!
How neat she spreads the wax!
And labours hard to stote it well
With the sweet food she makes.

In worhs os labour or of skill

Ι would be busy too ;
For Satan finds some mischies still
For idle hands to do.

In books, or work, or healthful play,
Let my first years be past,

That I may give for every day μ
Some good account at last„

wms, Divina and Moral Songs.

To a Stor.

Twinkle‚ twinkle, little Stat
How I wonder what you are!

Up above the world so high,
Like a qiamond in the sky.
