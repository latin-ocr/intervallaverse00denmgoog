MARY MORTIMER'S SONG.. 87

Was it the last gift os one
Who, in battle mitten,
Knowing that his course was run,
Sent the words there written?

None of these. But there were traced
Words that spake the beauty‚

Which adorned her soul and graced
Works os love and duty.

Tbese the words that locket bore,
“Loth with all my being
Ἰ “Ι do love Thee, and adore,
“Though I love unseeing.'’

Mary Mortimer's Song.

In this lovely little ginden, in a corner os the Bay,
He asked me if I cared for him, I could not say him
cena 'l’ > .

For, whelr we were but children, I had always felt,
“what joy

“ li my husband one day' should be like that pretty
sailor boy” l ¹ ¹

For four long years my Willie has been tossed upon
the main,

Anda sad sear has come o'er me that we ne’er may

’ meet again 3

For again the flowers are blooming in the merry month
of May, ’

„ And since I heard from Willie''tis a twelve month ’

and a day.
