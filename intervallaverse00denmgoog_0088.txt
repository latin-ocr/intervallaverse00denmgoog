Welcome all who've rowed at ali:

Oarsmen‚ steersmen, saint or sinner,

Since the race of ‘Twenty-nine :'
Therefore all, by death not bowled off,
As os yore, your strength combine,
And in gangs of nine be told off-

Not to paddle, 'but to dine.

Oh! what hands by hands are shaken!

Men still scribbling, men who've ceas'd:
Coun, church‚ camp, quill, care sorsaken,
Muster strong, and join the feast.

Captain os the earliest Eight ;

Unsurpassed in size and weight 3
