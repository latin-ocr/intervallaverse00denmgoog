Thou art the Truthz—Thy Word alone
True wisdom ean impart3

Tnou only canst inform the mind,
And purisy the hears

ThQu art the Life :-the rending tomb
Proclaims Thy conqu'ering arm;
And those who put their trust in Thee

· Nor death nor hell shall hama

Thou art the Way, the Truth‚ the Life:

Grant us that way to know,
That truth to keep, that lise to sain¹

Whose j0ys eternal flow.
G. W. Doasa, Ba'slzop os New serm.

Hymns‚ Ancient and Modern, 260.

Hark, my soull it is the Lord;
'Tis thy Saviour‚ hear His word3
Jesus speaks, and speaks 'to thee,
“Say, poor sinner, lov’st thou Me?

“I deliveffd thee when bound‚‘
“And, when bleeding‚ healed thy wound3
“Sought thee wandering‚ set thee right,

“Tumed thy darkness into light

“Can a woman's tendet care
“cease towards the child she bare?
“Yes, she may sorgetsul be, ’
“Yet will 1 remember thee. ·
