(Du idco roas to be os monosyllabic as possible.)

Man shall not live by meat and drinlr alone.
Is so he liv'd‚ man would not live, but die,
Τοο dull, too mean to list his thoughts on high,
A poor dead mass of flesh and skin, and bone,
Whose drinlr were poison, and his bread a stone.
Not recking of the God‚ lor ever nigh,
In field, in wood‚ in air and sea, and sky,
By those who love Him heard and felt and known ,
But this is Life—To hear thy Maker’s voice- ·
In all His works to hear and love His word-
In all the joy of nature to rejoice.
When bleats the lambkin‚ or when sings the bird,
When clouds clap thunder, when the sea makes mise,
By thy glad heart let God's own voice be heard.
Oakdown, Oct. 12, 1886.

1 never saw since Ι was born
A spot more lovely than Glenthorne 3
Nor sat in more enchanting seat
Thon where those winsome waters meet¹ 3
Nor ever spent a happier day
Than that which took us down that way;
Nor slept a sleep more sweet and sound‚
Than that which brought this—morning round,
On which 1, ere we part, must say,
“God bless the horne of Halliday!’'
