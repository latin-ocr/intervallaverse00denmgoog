4 INTER VALLA.

0st did the harvest to their sickle yield‚

Tbeir furrow oft the stubbom glebe has broke3
How jocund did they drive their team afieldl

How bow’d the woods beneath their sturdy strokel

Let not Ambition mock their useful toll,
Their homely jove, and destiny obscure ;

Nor Grandem hear with a disdainful smile

‘'Ihe short and simple annals of the poor.

The boast os heraldry, the pomp of pov'r,

And all that beanty, all that vealth e'er gave,
Avait alike th' inevitable bour:

The paths os glory lead but to the grave.

Nor you, ye proud‚ impute to these the fault,
Is Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,
Where, thro' the longdrawn aisle and fretted venit,
The pealing anthem swells the note of praiser

Can storied urn, or animated huot,
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?

Can Honour’s voice provoke the silent dust,
Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
Some heart once pregnant with celestini tire:
Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
Or wak'd to ecstasy the living lyre

But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
Rich with the spoils oi Time, did ne'er unrollt 2

Chill Penury repress'd their noble tage,
And froze the genial current· of the souh
