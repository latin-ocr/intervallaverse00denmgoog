Oh! uhat would have thought dear old honest John
HadIhhrh’ told him on weekday or Sunday,
That the Post would e’er list little MarJ'orie’s gift

From Repton to London in oue day?

But, whate’er Sir John Port in that day would have
thought,
His escutcheon will always remind me,

Audis doves can be doing any singing but cooing
With their voices, Ι hope they will tune 'em

To sing with their might to the praise of the Knight
Who founded our dear Raepandunum.
