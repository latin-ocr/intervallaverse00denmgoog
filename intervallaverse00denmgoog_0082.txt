E URIPJDES 61

Ι Fragments of Eunjmiz’cs.

Beauteous‚ 0 Lady, is this light os Day3

That ocean, rippled by the gentle breeze ;,
Earth‚ blossoming in Spring; that hounteous rill;
“ Yea, and os things as lovely could 1 tell

But nothing is so beautiful to see

As, to the childless, pining o'er their loss,
The light 'of fresh-born children in their home.

The conquer’d ost in glory lies,
Won by the way in which he dies.

He who from sear dares not abroad to roam
. Must pay his debt to Death at last at home.

1887.
