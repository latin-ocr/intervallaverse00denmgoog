THE omnnem BoAr naen. n

Up rose Sume-onon, ‘the Father‚'
Spoke of those untimely gone
To the stream Elysiam-rather
Os the ‘stroke they once put on '-
Most portentous (as we gether),
Like the seats they sat upon.

‘Temporis laudator actil’
So the young and thoughtless said ;
1 said nothing, but in fact 1
Thought ’twas time to go to bed.
Yet another toast still laeked‚ Ι
Mean the Caterers oi tho ‘spread’

These are honour’d. Then, to Cfflt‘rn
Warbling cheers‚ the best we know-

‘Best of chairmen, brave, nise, witty‚
Full of goodness, full os go,

(ΜΣ, ΜιΡ- (Oxford city)‚’-
Off to bed we gaily go.

Blest, thrice blest, is such revival,
Blest the man who can enjoy
Scenes like these, no mere survivel,
For theman recalls the boy‚
Hon'ring most his staunchest rival,

Hon'ring now without alloy.

Thus in generous emulation,
Cam and Isis both ate one3
Thus each passing generation
Earns the meed of duty done;
, Thus the glory of OuR Nnnott
‘ Shines wherever shines the Sun.
August, 1881.
